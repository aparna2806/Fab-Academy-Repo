#Week-18
<h2>Goal:</h2>
<li>Create a dissemination plan for your final project </li>
<li>Outline future possibilities and described how to make them probabilities </li>
<li>Choose a licence (open/closed) of your choice for your final mdef intervention </li>

<p>I believe that the project is easy to scale up as it's exists in repo format on guthub and has been uploaded on a website link through guthub pages. As for the json files, I would be willing to put my files online so that others could learn from what I'm making. I think it gives us the great opportunity to create new connections within our community. </p>

<h3>Why</h3>
Connecting people, form new communities, gain experience in this field.

<h3>What</h3>

<h3>Exhibition Description </h3>
<p>During this celebratory exhibition, we (the participants are written below) invite you to join us as we re-interpret our relationships with our ecological systems. On display, you will find designed artifacts, bio-remediation experiments, symbiotic wearables, interactive art displays, and audiovisuals that push us to re-think our parasitic role in the Anthropocene. We welcome you to enjoy live music and Spirulina cocktails, dress up as a bio-borg, or speculate on how to bio-remediate our plastic planet, form symbiotic relationships with microorganisms, and live in balance with our natural systems.</p>
