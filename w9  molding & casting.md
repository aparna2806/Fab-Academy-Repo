#week-9
<h5> 29th March </h5>
<h3> Molding and Casting </h3>
<li>During this week, we were introduced to the world of molding and casting techniques, going briefly through its history and then thoroughly over some major principles.

<li>I joined Kai and George to understand and do this challenge with them as they were familiar with the techniques which they deployed in Fab Challenge 1.

<li>We chose to make a wooden mold using the CNC milling. We decided to melt plastic cups into lego blocks at home.

<li>Below are some images of this process. Here, as it is in 2.5D, I did the design on Illustrator and later uploaded the .dxf files to easel and specified the hole types and depths.

Aside that, we used the CNC to make a 2-piece bowl presser mold for our biomaterials recipe.
