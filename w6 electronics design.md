<h3> Electronics Design </h3>
<h3> Task: </h3>
<p>Assignment: Design a PCB board also called breakout-board for your ESP32 HUZZAH 32 microcontrollers that allows you to connect an input (sensor) or an output (actuator) to your commercial board without cables.

<li> For this week assignment I will make a pcb using kicad containing potentiometer and led.</li>
<li>I started following a tutorial on youtube by making a simple pcb design to light up some leds. i used red, green and yellow (traffic light leds) </li>

<h3> Learnings: </h3>
<li>The basic shortcuts you need to know are 'M' while your mouse is on top of the object you wish to move and then move it to where you want and 'R' to rotate that object and 'E' to edit the properties of the component.
<li>We used components from the fab library and placed them on the sketch.
<li> Then we organise them and label them.
<li> Make connections and then generate the netlist.
<li> The final connections are made in pcb file and we export it as svg.
<li> Joseph helped me understand the entire process again and reminded of the minute details like exporting the front face layer, exporting at 1000pp quality in the same size from Inkscape.
<li>I'd three files for milling: the holes, the circuit and the outline.
<li> when I was confused about paramters to be changed. I followed the video that was uploaded by Joseph on Classes tab.
<li>Jeremy helped Borka and me to understand the goal of creating our own PCBs and he advised us to prototype on breadboard first before deisgning to make sure the connection works and we have the components.
<li> During the process, I realised it quite important to understanf the functionality of the components to be more clear.
