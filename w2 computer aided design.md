#week-2
<h5>february 9 </h5>
<h3> Computer Aided Design and Cutting: </h3>

<li> I'm pretty excited for this week as I always wanted to get better at making shapes and laser cutting them. I used Fusion before in my bachelors but never put in efforts to actually learn it well. So this time I am going to give my best and also not forget to have fun whilst the process of learning;) </li>

<li> An easy way of thinking in software language was looking at it from top view angle. Basically deconstructing the 3d shapes into 2d curves. To be honest, it was challenging at first but Pippa and Jeremy helped me understand it by showing few demos. </li>

<h3> Nurbs Vs Mesh Concept </h3>
<li> Nurbs objects are always separate from each other and they have 4 sides. It generates precise geometry with smooth surfaces. They are mathematical and defined using control points. Many 3D scans produce nurbs model. Whereas Mesh model is a collection of points, vertices and edges and creates non-mathematically. Modelling with mesh is simpler. So it is the preferred methods for STL 3d printing.

<h3> Tools introduced </h3>
<h5> 2D Design Tools </h5>
<li> Inkscape </li>

<h5> 3D Design Tools </h5>
<li> Blender </li>
<li> Rhino </li>
<li> Grasshopper </li>

<h3> Weekly Task </h3>
<p>Design and create a 3d model.</p>

<p>I decided to make a vase by following this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Th-4uvq3jMk&t=324s using the loft tool. I did this on Rhino.</p>
