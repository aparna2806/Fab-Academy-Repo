<h3> Printed Circuit Boards </h3>

<p>We learned about printed circuit boards (PCB) and different ways to fabricate them. I found it super exciting to make our own PCB boards. I think its quite liberating in some ways. PCBs are good for preventing short circuits and keeping the connections intact. In the Fab Lab Barcelona facilities, we have access to the The Roland monoFab SRM-20.</p>

<li>Cutting
 -<p>The file has to be prepared before in a software developed by MIT, modsproject and the outputs are 2 files : one for the traces and one for the outline.</P>
-<p>I enjoyed the process of soldering, although it was more difficult than it appeared.</p>

-<p>Julia and I were able to solder our line of LED lights onto the pre-cut PCB board within the time we had..</p>

<li> Soldering
<li>Soldering is a process in which two or more items are joined together by melting and putting a filler metal into the joint, the filler metal having a lower melting point than the adjoining metal.
<li>We also learned how to solder led lights and resistors onto the pre-milled PCB boards.
I watched some soldering videos as the challenge for this week was comparatively simpler.

<h3>Learnings:</h3>
<li> I needed Julia's help to hold the wire for me in the start. And later we were watching a video on soldering, we realised we can tape the wire down and work single handedly.
<li> I could have tested with multimeter and power supply very quickly.
