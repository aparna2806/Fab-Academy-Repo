#week-7
<h5> 15th March </h5>
<h3> Computer Controlled Machining </h3>
<li>During the session, we were introduced on how to use the machine. The different kinds of cnc, the main parts. I found the process of creating a GCODE for each machine challenging. I didn't try but I found tough to flow through the

<li>For the first one, I will work on something that consists of straight lines. But later I plan on exploring the depth and organic shapes.

<h3>Learnings: </h3>
<li>Because of the thickness of the end mill, we cannot have 90Â° angles in the design.

<li>Joineries: T-bone, dog-bone, Mickey Mouse. So to make sure the joints fit well, I needed to modify their shape with either T-bone or dog-bone or mickey mouse shapes.

<li>Kerf: The kerf is the end mill diameter.

<li> The design needs to be bigger : for the joints to fit.

<li>Chip load: is a measurement of the thickness of material removed by each cutting edge during a cut.

<li>Calculation are as follows: Chip Load = Feed Rate (inches per minute) / (RPM x number of flutes).

<h3>Task: </h3>
 You can use up to a maximun of half full board ( that means 1200x1200mm) of the available material per student. 15 mm thick pine plywood boards.

<li> I wish to make a book stand for my room to gather all my books in one place but also makes it look nice.

<li> But for now I'll use the CNC week for cutting it for microchallenge 2 where Angel, Jose and I wish to make a base out of wood and place objects on them.
