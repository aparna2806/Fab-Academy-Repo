<h3> Interface and Application Programming </h3>
<h3>Task:</h3>
Code an interface with the tools provided during the (processing,P5JS, MitAppInventor,Aframe,NodeRed) or other alternatives software that interfaces a user with an input and/or output device that you want to use. Interpret and implement design and programming protocols to create a Graphic User Interface (GUI).
<h3>Learnings</h3>
<li>Processing
<li>MIT App inventor
<li>A Frame - is based on top of HTML, making it simple to get started. Used for building virtual reality (VR) experiences
<li>Node Redflow - based development tool for visual programming for wiring together hardware devices, APIs and online services as part of the Internet of Things.
<li>Serial Communication
<li>Blender - is a multitool software, capable of 3D modeling, Video edditing, produciong CAM files and even interact with the real world. We can program on it using Python.
<li>p5js is a Javasript libaray developed by the Processing Foundation to make a web-based version of Processing.
<li>Second half of the class was pretty cool. Victor gave us a short tutorial on how to program from Blender and how to transform it also in a visual representation, either 3D or 3D.
<h3>Designing_an_interface</h3>
Didas, Nikita and I created an interface that allowed us to communicate with Arduino IDE in a graphical way. We wanted to activate an air pump by tapping on our phone screens for our micro challenge 3. Link to the project- https://github.com/aparna2806/fab-challenge-3
