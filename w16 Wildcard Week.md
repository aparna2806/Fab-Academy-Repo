<h5> May 17 </h5>
<h3> Wildcard Week </h3>
I chose to work on inflatables for wildcard week. I find it super fun and I think I will use this mechanism for my final project.
<li> Dafne was kind enough to share projects that were along the same approach:
https://class.textile-academy.org/2022/saskia-helinska/finalproject.html and
https://fabacademy.org/2018/labs/barcelona/students/javier-alboguijarro/week16.html

<h3>Process</h3>
<li>I took a garbage bag and decided to laser cut at two different temperatures (one to stick the edges and other one to cut)
Sealing Previous values-
<li>Power: 3
<li>Speed: 1
<li>Frequency: 1000 hz
<li>z offset: 16

<p>Cutting Values: </p>
<li>Power: 5
<li>Speed: 1
<li>Frequency: 1000 hz
<li>z offset: 10

<li>I gave an offset of 0.5m between each seal layer in the rhino laser cut file (blue) and then 0.8m for the the cut layer (red). The order was first we let the seal layer and then the cut layer run.
