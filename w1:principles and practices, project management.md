#week-1
<h5> February 2 </h5>
<h3> Principles and practices, project management </h3>

<li>The first session was a segway into discovering alternatives and options to apps or websites that we are currently using.

<li>I created my website using Atom and started to code using markdown style that I was introduced to by Guillem. I created all the different folders that we will be using in the future over the weeks of micro and macro challenges and kept the template ready.

<li> This was my first time using Git and I must tell it was confusing and I tried questioning the purpose of hosting the website on  it.  In few days I learnt more about it on how it could be used to effectively for collaborations.

<li> It was pretty exciting as we discussed the structure of the fab academy course and what to expect on a weekly basis and the intention behind fab challenges. I think the course is designed pretty well for a beginner who has some sort of difficulty in making. I felt very comfortable with the pace of learning and was re-insured that its a safe space.

<li>After doing some research on some of last year students' websites which was fun to navigate through and have a sense of discovery. I think I like the way of documenting from:

 -Krzysztof: his way of structuring and organising every element. It makes it pleasant to browse through the different weekly tasks and gives it a more lively touch.

 -Sara: I really like about her way of documenting is that everything makes sense and every little thing is coherent with each other. She focuses more on reflection than images. It gave very artistic vibe.
