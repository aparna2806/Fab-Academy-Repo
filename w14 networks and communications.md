#week-11
<h3> Inputs Outputs Devices </h3>
This week we continued our studies and built more skills in the topics of electronics. We studied about KiCad which was developed in CERN, to draw PCB schematics, create a layout factoring in the footprint of each component, and exporting it to be milled.

For the weekly task, with Borka we did a small project which helps us to get familiar with this topic and learn the basics for further development, so I designed a PCB board for a potentiometer output, which controls the LED brightness.

We used modsproject.org to convert the inkscpae models into roland format using this tutorial https://fabacademy.org/2019/docs/FabAcademy-Tutorials/week04_electronic_production/mods.html and Joseph's help.
