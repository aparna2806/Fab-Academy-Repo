<h3> Networks and Communications</h3>

<p>This week we were introduced to networks and communication protocols for connecting systems due to location, paralelism, modularity and interference. I liked the metaphor about the onion and is layers to understand this concepts.</p>

<p>The task was to send a message between two microcontrollers (boards). First we set up the two microcontroller, with cables and bread board and connected them to the Arduino program. Also we followed the tutorial which included the “Writer” and “Reader” codes, where one microcontroller is the writer and the other one is the reader. We used the incoming byte 13 which refers to carriage return which will help us translate the numbers into letters. Also we added codes so we could see the name of the person sending the message. Then we connected both boards both ways so the communication would go forwards and backwards.</p>

<p>For the weekly task, with Borka we did a small project which helps us to get familiar with this topic and learn the basics for further development, so I designed a PCB board for a potentiometer output, which controls the LED brightness.</p>

<p>And also to do so, we followed a tutorial since we had no knowledge at all of how to do it with an ESP8266.</p>

<p>Of course, the thing that we built is really basic and doesn't have much function, but using this protocol we can play with different sensors and get outputs remotely that could be transformed into Processing. The same code can be used in many other applications just by changing the void loop.</p>
