#week-17
<h3> Applications and Implications </h3>
<li>The main objective of this week is to begin focusing on your final projects and interventions, defining the scope and developing a project plan for the rest of the course. Some of the questions you should reflect on it and answer in your website:<li>
Questions:
<li>What will it do?</li>
It will be an interactive space to disseminate story about parasitical relationships and have a discussion between people from different disciplines- biologists, philosophers, designers etc to form a holistic view on this subject.

<li> What will you design? </li>
Design interactions and make the research more accessible in forms of poem. I will use p5js language to do the interactions. “Epoch of the Greedy Parasite” is a desktop collection of poetry, strange dreams, and broken thoughts.  Torn between the phenomenon of feeding on and feeding off,  a parasitic relationship is formed between the ecological systems. This artwork is exploring our relationship with the planet, just like fleas’ relationship with us- strategic and slow destruction.

<li>What questions need to be answered?</li>
The above poems in the project are an attempt to get out of our individual heads and look at us collectively as a species. This project came from my desperation to answer my personal questions about “how are we doing as a species?” in a world full of ecological dependent relationships. I went on to give adjectives to us as parasitical creatures as our relationship to the planet is the same as a leech has to us. These adjectives emerge from multi disciplines - from biology to philosophy to theology. I always wanted to know what would people from different disciplines and their expertise think of us as species. It’s an effort to create such a space.
