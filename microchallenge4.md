#microchallenge4
<h5> Challenge 4 </h5>
<p> This last challenge George and I decided to work together. We have come together for different reasons- I wanted to focus on the final project that will be part of mdefest and George was interested in learning p5js. The aim is to learn to code the ideas we are having conceptually and translate it to code. I got immense support and guidance from Jeremy for this challenge.</p>

## What you will find in this repo
1. Documentation for micro challenge 04
2. Images of the outcome
3. Thesis Prototypes

## Project description
<p>Theme:A series of digital narratives that provoke the user to look at the world through the lens of parasitic relationships and further investigate the characteristics that define our role and behaviours as a parasite. I worked on miro gathering inspiration and read some more reading material.</p>

## Softwares used
- p5.js
- Atom

## Concept Development
- I referred to the visuals done by Alien Melon for her project- Everything is going to be okay *inspiration*.

## In Process
1) The concept of sprites and getting each image in a sequence and moving the x position of the image.
<img title="miro" alt="brainstorm" src="/images/sprite.gif" width="560"/>
- An empty array created for images
- Using the push method to add images into the array
- Making the sketch move in the x direction


2) Using setTimeout() and setInterval() to create a delay for animation.
<img title="miro" alt="brainstorm" src="/images/sprite2.gif" width="560"/>
- Example of the syntax:
//declaring setTimeout
<p>setTimeout(textDis,18000);</p>
<p>setTimeout(newShape,22000);</p>
//declaring function
<p>function textDis(){</p>
<p>showText=true;</p>
<p>setTimeout(textHide,3000);</p>
<p>};</p>

<p>if (showText){</p>
<p> textFont(font1);</p>
<p> textSize(200);</p>
<p> fill('yellow');</p>
<p> text('epoch of the anthropocene',15,280);</p>
}</p>
