<h3> Computer Aided Design and Cutting: </h3>
<p>Create a small object using parametric design tools. The object should be assembled in a press-fit way</p>

<h3>Interesting Links!</h3>
<li>The Pasta Project by Shira & TalWe transformed pasta into a 3d press fit-kit.
<li>Why you can't cut Fiberglass. Documentation of materials not to lasercut.

<p> I wanted to design a flat cylindrical base having the possibility of growing seeds.</p>

<p>I was looking at the possibility of gift economies/ care economy where we could grow in order to express. Gardening as a way to document what to feel but also to express. </p>

<h3>Process:</h3>
<li>For this assignment specifically, we also were supposed to work with parametric design systems, which gives us the option to change specific measurements and dimensions in our designs without having to repeat the whole process as a whole. This system would automatically adapt our design to the dimensions we input at our convenience.

<li>I am still struggling a little bit with Rhino, but destined to learn to use the software fully because I like the workflow it presents. The file I prepared:

<li> The settings of cutting mdf 3mm:
Cutting: outer pieces

Engraving: Multiple lines for bending the sheet
