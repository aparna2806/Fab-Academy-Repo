#week-5
<h5>1st March </h5>
<h3> 3D Printitng and Scanning: </h3>
<h4>Learnings:</h4>

<li>I wasn't aware of slicing as a concept to get more approximate parts of the file. We were shown to slice a 3D modelled part to have optimal results.
<li> We could use many parameters to have a refined version of the file such as layer height, infill, directionality, shell, etc. It can be used by slicing program like Cura or PrusaSlicer. For this to be possible we need to have the file in a mesh format that can be STL or OBJ.
<li>We had an explanation about paste 3D printing. They modified an Ender-3 to be able to print with any kind of paste such as clay or whatever that can stand up after being printed. They showed the mechanism used and the slicing program, that was created with Grasshopper. Then we printed a vase with mashed potatoes to test it.
<h4> Task </h4>
The task for this week was pretty clear: 3D print something that you have designed that can only be built with additive manufacturing techniques. Simplifying, something with complex shapes or patterns that would be difficult to do with injection, CNC or else.

<li> An easy way of thinking in software language was looking at it from top view angle. Basically deconstructing the 3d shapes into 2d curves. To be honest, it was challenging at first but Pippa and Jeremy helped me understand it by showing few demos. </li>

<li>I built a graffiti bottle holder which was part of an idea Vikrant and I have been discussing about. So I thought it would be nice if I can print something that I'm going to use. </li>
